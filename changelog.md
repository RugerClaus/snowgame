Added a way to win the game and choose to restart. Contrast that menu with game over. 
Updated the way snow spawns. Now snow spawns at different sizes at random
Updated the way player gains size. The player size now increases based off the size of the snow it has collided with.
That is a featured I'd initially envisioned, which hadn't been working earlier on.
There are now 20 levels.
The snowfall decreases upon level up by 50 entities
