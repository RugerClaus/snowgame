Run at your own risk

The game may not be performant on slower processors. Rendering in pygame is done on the CPU, so your CPU will heavily affect performance.

I have only tested this on an AMD Ryzen 7 5700X in a Microsoft Windows 10 environment using Python 3.12

**GAME INSTRUCTIONS:**

Press and hold A to move left.
Press and hold D to move right.

The object of the game is to capture snowflakes and push the grow meter to the max to level up.
You need to avoid the falling rocks as collision with a rock forces a game over.
Beating level 20 wins the game.
The player is constantly *melting* and the rate increases depending on size. I may change this mechanic
