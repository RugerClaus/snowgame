<p>Run at your own risk</p>

<p>The game may not be performant on slower processors. Rendering in pygame is done on the CPU, so your CPU will heavily affect performance.</p>

<p>I have only tested this on an AMD Ryzen 7 5700X in a Microsoft Windows 10 environment using Python 3.12</p>

**GAME INSTRUCTIONS:**

<p>Press and hold A to move left.</p>
<p>Press and hold D to move right.</p>

<p>The object of the game is to capture snowflakes and push the grow meter to the max to level up.</p>
<p>You need to avoid the falling rocks as collision with a rock forces a game over.</p>
<p>Powerups are blue, red and green and come at different level thresholds.</p>
<p>Currently there are only 3 powerup types that can all be collected by level 20</p>
<p>Blue: Absorb Rock - Colliding witha rock does not end the game while active.</p>
<p>Green: Stop Shrinking - Temporarly prevents melting</p>
<p>Red: Grow - Increases size gradually for duration</p>
<p>Power ups last for 5 seconds at the beginning of  the game and the time increases upon reaching score thresholds:</p>
<p>10000: 6 seconds</p>
<p>20000: 6.5 seconds</p>
<p>50000: 6.87 seconds</p>
<p>100000: 7.5 seconds</p>
<p>175000: 8 seconds</p>
<p>Levels are infinite</p>
<p>The player constantly melts - shrinks - over time. The shrink rate increases with size and can be slowed or stopped by collecting powerups</p>
